        		  	<h3> What happened during covid?</h3>
        		  	<p>During the pandemic, many small businesses struggled to pay their rent and to make any money at all. This allowed for developers to easily pay out these small businesses for their property. The empty lot in front of North Main Street was soon sold and developed into the Tarry Lighthouse building with 27,905 square feet of retail space and 209 apartments. Businesses were forced out or bought out all of a sudden and the town was outraged.</p>

        		  	<h3> Tarry Lighthouse</h3>
        		  	<p>The developers of the Tarry Lighthouse building emphasize that the new building would bring one hundred fifty-five permanent jobs and provide Port Chester with $1 million of additional property tax revenue each year, which would help the town financially. X-S Hair salon, which is owned by two sisters and their mother, who immigrated from Peru to the United States, is suing the developers. In court papers, the salon owners say efforts by the developers to buy out their lease or arrange for a new location have not been effective. They also said the developers are using fear tactics such as having their gas being shut off and placing construction debris behind the shop to drive them out.</p>
